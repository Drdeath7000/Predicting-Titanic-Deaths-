# Predicting-Titanic-Deaths-

In this file we provide two different ways of prediction, using decision trees and random forest trees:

• Analyzed the sinking of the RMS Titanic and predicted the number of survivals and losses using Decision Trees
• Built a decision tree model, trained by 20 models with varying max depths (1-20) to study the number of people who survived the titanic
• Calculated the training accuracy and testing accuracy of the split data
• Observed there is a negative correlation between max depth and depth of the tree, concluding of an overfitting issue
• Improved the accuracy from 65% up to 90% of the model by testing various max depths for the decision tree
• Created a confusion matrix for the decision tree and calculated the accuracy, and precision of the decision tree to study the error made by the classifiers
